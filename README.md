# PedestrianDetection
This is the .java source code related to the Pedestrian Detection using a Dynamic Vision Sensor. The project has been developped using Netbeans on jAER.

The .java files included on this folder need to be compiled and added to the jAER framework for filter design. Once added to the project, you can select them and use them by oppening the jAER app.

For more information about the filter design and how to select/include more filters on jAER app please go to https://sourceforge.net/projects/jaer/.
